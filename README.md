# GIS Maps Showcase Web App

This web application showcases all the final GIS maps created during academic projects, including land use, watershed, least-cost path, and environmental analysis maps. The app provides an interactive interface for exploring geospatial data and visualizing spatial analyses.

## Features
- Display of multiple GIS thematic maps (raster and vector data)
- Interactive map layers with zoom and pan functionality
- Integration of spatial analysis results (e.g., least-cost paths, watershed boundaries, suitability areas)
- User-friendly interface for viewing map details
- Developed using web technologies for global accessibility

## Usage
1. Visit the GitHub Pages link: https://jathursan1999.github.io/GIS_Maps/
2. Explore the maps by selecting different projects or analysis types
3. Zoom, pan, and toggle layers to interact with the geospatial data

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Leaflet.js for interactive web maps
- GeoJSON for geospatial data
- React.js for frontend (if applicable)
- GIS software used: ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Google Earth Pro

## Map Categories Included
- Watershed / Catchment Area Maps
- Least-Cost Path Analysis Maps
- Suitability and MCDM/AHP Analysis Maps
- 3D Analysis and Terrain Maps
- Environmental Impact Assessment Maps
- Network Analysis Maps

## Optional
- Screenshots of key maps can be included in the `images` folder
- Additional project documentation can be linked for deeper insights
